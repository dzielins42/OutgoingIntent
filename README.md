# Outgoing Intent

Small library to handle `Intent`s leaving your application, that are expected to come back with some result. Useful for handling stuff in Custom Tab, external internet browser or thir party application.

Based on `AuthorizationManagementActivity` from [AppAuth for Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android), but now you can use it for more things than only OAuth 2.
